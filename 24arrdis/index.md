abstract: "Although climate change poses a well-established risk to human health, present-day health impacts, particularly those resulting from climate-induced behavioral changes, are under-quantified. Analyzing the U.S. West Coast wildfires of September 2020, we found that poor air quality drives people indoors, increasing the circulation of airborne pathogens like COVID-19. Indoor masking rates as low as 10% can mitigate this risk, offering a clear path to enhance public health responses during wildfires.
