      <title>Emerging and Re-emerging threats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The landscape of infectious disease epidemics is changing fast.
The COVID-19 pandemic was proof that new pathogens may emerge and may cause large-scale epidemics with a substantial burden on global welfare: strains of influenza, coronaviruses or multiresistant bacteria are among the most closely surveilled candidates. Much methodological research is needed to prepare us for &lt;em&gt;disease X&lt;/em&gt; - the next pandemic.
But well-known pathogens are an equally looming threat, as they move and adapt to new geographic areas and communities or re-emerge where they had been eliminated. It is the case, for instance, of mosquito-borne diseases like arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya, Zika) and malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we develop estimates of risk and vulnerability at high spatial and temporal resolution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal resolution of intervention aimed at prevention and containment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we apply our methodologies both to hypothetical emergence events of respiratory pathogens and to the importation and establishement of vector-borne pathogens to previously unaffected areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
