	abstract = {Traditional academic training of early-career researchers is often conditional to the funding, structure and managerial style of the research group. With the workshop Complexity72h (www.complexity72h.com), we present an original format where early-stage researchers—from Master students to early-stage group leaders—can experience the whole scientific process, testing and acquiring writing, collaborative and leading skills in just 72 h.},
