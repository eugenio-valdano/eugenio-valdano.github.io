	abstract = {Although climate change poses a well-established risk to human health, present-day health impacts, particularly those resulting from climate-induced behavioral changes, are under-quantified. Analyzing the U.S. West Coast wildfires of September 2020, we found that poor air quality drives people indoors, increasing the circulation of airborne pathogens like COVID-19. Indoor masking rates as low as 10\% can mitigate this risk, offering a clear path to enhance public health responses during wildfires.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award number R01GM123007.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The indoor seasonality index we used is publicly available at https://github.com/bansallab/indoor_outdoor.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.YesThe data generated in this study are publicly available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/wildfires_project). The daily Air Quality Index (AQI) in all U.S. counties is collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is available on their website. https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/wildfires_project},
