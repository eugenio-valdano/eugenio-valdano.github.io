	abstract = {Assessing epidemic risk following pathogen introduction is crucial in infectious disease epidemiology. Risk is commonly encoded through reproduction ratios, which underpin operational decision-making. In spatially structured populations, both local and cross-community transmission shape epidemic trends, a feature that standard reproduction ratios fail to capture simultaneously. Here, we use multitype branching processes to define the outbreak reproduction ratio Rob, a reformulation applicable across pathogens, epidemics and transmission routes, enabling community-specific, but system-aware, risk assessment. We test Rob on respiratory pathogens and estimate it prior to emergence using aggregated contact matrices, enabling spatially resolved risk assessment even with limited data and computational resources. Estimates across countries reveal heterogeneous spatial risk, not captured by standard metrics. Rob can also be estimated from early-phase surveillance data, as we show using SARS-CoV-2 in Canada, where it correctly identifies community risk. Rob represents a concise and practicable framework for interpreting epidemic risk in spatially structured populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementHorizon Europe grant SIESTA (101131957）Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
