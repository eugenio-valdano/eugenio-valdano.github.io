      <title>Postdoc Position - Large machine learning models for computational epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025postdocdiscoreel/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025postdocdiscoreel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are hiring a postdoctoral researcher to work full-time on the DiscoReel project. The postdoc will work on developing machine and deep learning methods for epidemic modeling, integrating them with mechanistic models and focusing on foundation models. The candidate should have a background in computer science, physics or applied math and previous experience in designing and traning large machine learning models. No prior experience in epidemiology is needed, but interest in applying computational modeling to improve public health is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is likely to start in early 2026 and last 1 year, renewable. The postdoc will be employed by Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and will also be affiliated to the Faculty of Health of Sorbonne University. Salary will be according to Inserm&amp;rsquo;s national salary grids. The postdoc will work at the Sorbonne Outbreaks Modeling Center (SUMOC) and Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health (IPLESP), interacting with senior and junior modelers and epidemiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fit the profile and are interested in having more information please contact Eugenio Valdano. To apply for the position please use &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/kZs1gLBEPVKuXo5KA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Internship - Causal analysis of PrEP and sexual behavior in MSM</title>
      <link>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025interncausal/</link>

      <guid>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025interncausal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are opening an internship position at Inserm (Paris) to work on the causal analysis of PrEP uptake and sexual behavior change among MSM, as part of the PP-IMPACT project funded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://anrs.fr/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANRS-MIE&lt;/a&gt;. The intern will work under the supervision of Eugenio Valdano and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ckassaad.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charles Assaad&lt;/a&gt;, expert in causal inference. The analysis will use observational cohort data from Portugal and France to identify bidirectional causal links between behavior and PrEP adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have more information please contact either E. Valdano or C. Assaad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply for the internship please use &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/oJGwUzQaGxwM9GLKA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. The position will be filled as soon a suitable candidate is found.&lt;/p&gt;
