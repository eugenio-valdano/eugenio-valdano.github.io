      <guid>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025postdocdiscoreel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are hiring a postdoctoral researcher to work full-time on the DiscoReel project. The postdoc will work on developing machine and deep learning methods for epidemic modeling, integrating them with mechanistic models and focusing on foundation models. The candidate should have a background in computer science, physics or applied math and previous experience in designing and traning large machine learning models. No prior experience in epidemiology is needed, but interest in applying computational modeling to improve public health is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is likely to start in early 2026 and last 1 year, renewable. The postdoc will be employed by Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and will also be affiliated to the Faculty of Health of Sorbonne University. Salary will be according to Inserm&amp;rsquo;s national salary grids. The postdoc will work at the Sorbonne Outbreaks Modeling Center (SUMOC) and Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health (IPLESP), interacting with senior and junior modelers and epidemiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fit the profile and are interested in having more information please contact Eugenio Valdano. To apply for the position please use &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/kZs1gLBEPVKuXo5KA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. The position will be filled as soon a suitable candidate is found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internship - Causal analysis of PrEP and sexual behavior in MSM</title>
      <link>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025interncausal/</link>

      <guid>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025interncausal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are opening an internship position at Inserm (Paris) to work on the causal analysis of PrEP uptake and sexual behavior change among MSM, as part of the PP-IMPACT project funded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://anrs.fr/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANRS-MIE&lt;/a&gt;. The intern will work under the supervision of Eugenio Valdano and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ckassaad.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Charles Assaad&lt;/a&gt;, expert in causal inference. The analysis will use observational cohort data from Portugal and France to identify bidirectional causal links between behavior and PrEP adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have more information please contact either E. Valdano or C. Assaad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply for the internship please use &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/oJGwUzQaGxwM9GLKA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. The position will be filled as soon a suitable candidate is found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internship - Creation of a user interface for mobility-based epidemic risk monitoring in resource-constrained settings</title>
      <link>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025internsnowflake/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.evmodelers.org/job/2025internsnowflake/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Patterns of human mobility shape spatial contact networks that determine how respiratory pathogens spread and how well surveillance systems detect epidemic activity. Mathematical models can combine large-scale mobility data with epidemiological surveillance to estimate and forecast epidemic risk (see &lt;a href=&#34;www.evmodelers.org/post/2024rt-meta/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many resource-limited settings, there is limited capacity to handle data and run epidemiological models. The intern will collaborate with our partners at &lt;a href=&#34;www.snowflake.com&#34;&gt;Snowflake&lt;/a&gt; to develop a web application that integrates user-provided surveillance data with mobility datasets to automatically generate epidemic indicators and trend estimates, without requiring modeling expertise. The prototype will be tested and applied to respiratory virus surveillance in Gabon, in collaboration with our local partners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intern will work in Python-based environments with Snowflake engineers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate (computationally lightweight) epidemic models and mobility datasets into the backend of the web app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the frontend interface design and data visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have more information please contact Eugenio Valdano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply for the internship please use &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/oJGwUzQaGxwM9GLKA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. The position will be filled as soon a suitable candidate is found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for an intern to join our research on integrating large-scale, high-resolution mobility data to build exposure risk maps for infectious disease epidemics. The data will be provided by Meta - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evmodelers.org/post/2024rt-meta/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;see this for how we used similar data&lt;/a&gt;. We will study how time spent in different locations shapes the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, applying to mosquito-borne diseases. Basic Python skills are required. Previous knowledge/experience in data analysis is a plus. Candidates will generally be 1st-year or 2nd-year master students in computer science, machine learning, physics, applied mathematics, engineering or other relevant fields.&lt;/p&gt;
