While much attention has been paid to the direct health consequences of these events, such as chronic diseases from poor air quality, less is known about how behavioral shifts induced by such events can influence the transmission of infectious diseases. This study investigates how wildfire-induced changes in human behavior during the U.S. West Coast wildfires of 2020 may affect the spread of airborne diseases. Using a mobility data-driven indoor activity index, we find that the wildfire-induced deterioration of air quality led to a substantial increase in indoor activities, fostering conditions conducive to airborne disease transmission. Specifically, counties in Oregon and Washington experienced an average 10.8% and 14.3% increase in indoor activity, respectively, during the wildfire events, with major cities like Portland and Seattle experiencing increases of 11% and 16%, respectively. We quantify these behavioral changes and integrate them into an SIR epidemic model to characterize the increased indoor activity and disease dynamics. The model predicts the greatest impact on diseases with shorter generation times, such as RSV and influenza. Our results show that even a modest increase in indoor mask-wearing (as low as 10%) could significantly reduce the risk of disease spread in these settings, with higher compliance needed for more substantial reductions. As wildfires and other climate-related events become more frequent, integrating behavioral responses into public health policies will be crucial to mitigate the compounded risks of climate change and its secondary health impacts.

Floods are known to cause direct injury and favor the spread of many waterborne and vector-borne pathogens. Their effect on the circulation of respiratory pathogens, like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, is, however, still unclear. In this study, we quantify this effect through the analysis of large-scale behavioral data coupled to mathematical models of epidemic spread. We focus on the devastating floods occurred in Italy in 2023 and measure how they impacted human contact patterns within and between communities. We find a substantial increase in contacts occurring 3 weeks after the floods, both among residents of the affected areas and between them and those living in distant, unaffected areas of Italy. Then, through mathematical simulations, we determine that these disrupted contact patterns can carry a circulating pathogen to previously unaffected geographic areas, as well as increasing infection counts across the country. Our findings may help set up protocols to use large-scale human contact data to contain epidemic outbreaks before, during and in the aftermath of floods.","tags":[],"title":"How floods may affect the spatial spread of respiratory pathogens: the case of Emilia-Romagna, Italy in May 2023","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefania Fiandrino","Andrea Bizzotto","Giorgio Guzzetta","Stefano Merler","Federico Baldo","Eugenio Valdano","Alberto Mateo Urdiales","Antonino Bella","Francesco Celino","Lorenzo Zino","Alessandro Rizzo","Yuhan Li","Nicola Perra","Corrado Gioannini","Paolo Milano","Daniela Paolotti","Marco Quaggiotto","Luca Rossi","Ivan Vismara","Alessandro Vespignani","Nicolò Gozzi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1740787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740787200,"objectID":"3594cf6bb66ae2906dea52100ea3b294","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/25fiacol/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/25fiacol/","section":"publication","summary":"Collaborative hubs that integrate multiple teams to generate ensemble projections and forecasts for shared targets are now regarded as state-of-the-art in epidemic predictive modeling. In this paper, we introduce Influcast, Italy’s first epidemic forecasting hub for influenza-like illness. During the 2023/2024 winter season, Influcast provided 20 rounds of forecasts, involving five teams and eight models to predict influenza-like illness incidence up to four weeks in advance at the national and regional administrative level. The individual forecasts were synthesized into an ensemble and benchmarked against a baseline model. Across all models, the ensemble most frequently ranks among the top performers at the national level considering different metrics and forecasting rounds.

Traditional models typically require extensive epidemiological data and may struggle in data-limited settings. Transformer-based, foundation AI models have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities in various time series applications. We investigated whether they can be the basis of a new epidemic modeling framework. We evaluated five foundation models - TabPFN-TS, TimeGPT, TimesFM, Lag-Llama, and Chronos - across diverse pathogens, diseases and locations, including influenza-like illness, RSV, chickenpox, dengue, COVID-19 and neonatal bronchiolitis. Models were tested for long-term forecasting (multi-season predictions), short-term forecasting (four-week-ahead predictions), and epidemic peak timing estimation. We also assessed their ability to generate counterfactual scenarios in policy evaluation, using COVID-19 restriction measures in Italy, RSV immunization in France, and synthetic epidemic data as validation. Foundation models demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, possibly outperforming traditional statistical and mechanistic models in data-limited contexts. They generated multi-season forecasts and short-term forecasts with good accuracy and stable uncertainty. They gave reliable peak timing estimates months before the actual peak. In policy evaluation, TabPFN-TS accurately estimated intervention effects, matching estimates from an independent epidemiological study. Our findings suggest that foundation models can complement existing approaches in epidemic modeling. Their ability to generate accurate forecasts and counterfactual analyses with minimal data input highlights their potential for real-time public health decision-making, particularly in emergent and resource-constrained settings. Further research should explore domain-specific adaptations to optimize performance for infectious disease modeling.","tags":["featured"],"title":"Foundation time series models for forecasting and policy evaluation in infectious disease epidemics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"Eugenio will speak ath the EU Innovation Day 2025 at Meta, to reflect upon how nontraditional open data and open-source AI can fuel innovation in research and public service delivery in the EU.\n","date":1738627200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738627200,"objectID":"e626d794e799b38cd86b933b3f52a127","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2025metaeu/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2025metaeu/","section":"event","summary":"Eugenio will speak ath the EU Innovation Day 2025 at Meta, to reflect upon how nontraditional open data and open-source AI can fuel innovation in research and public service delivery in the EU.","tags":["dissemination","keynote talk / seminar"],"title":"EU Innovation Day 2025 at Meta","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alberto Antonioni","Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738540800,"objectID":"99461af4dbdeb6716a9d3751f7cd9c5d","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/25antcom/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/25antcom/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditional academic training of early-career researchers is often conditional to the funding, structure and managerial style of the research group.

Despite the high efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, its accessibility and uptake remain uneven across countries. This study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP policies across 20 EU countries. Methods We employed a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission among MSM. The model incorporated data on sexual behavior, PrEP adherence and healthcare costs to evaluate the impact of five distinct PrEP eligibility policies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, HIV-related deaths prevented, PrEP coverage, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Findings Policies by the US CDC and Belgian authorities were the most effective in reducing HIV infections and deaths, driven by higher PrEP coverage. However, the WHO policy emerged as the most costeffective across the 20 countries, despite its current use being limited to Denmark. The European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines also showed potential, although not currently implemented. In countries without PrEP reimbursement, reducing drug costs would significantly expand the range of cost-effective policy options. Interpretation Optimizing PrEP policies is crucial for reducing HIV incidence among MSM in the EU. Broad eligibility criteria maximize effectiveness, while WHO guidelines offer a cost-effective alternative in constrained economic contexts. Our findings highlight the need for policy adjustments to enhance PrEP accessibility, inform national health strategies, and achieve sustainable HIV prevention across diverse settings.","tags":[],"title":"Comparing the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Policies for Recommending and Providing HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis to Men Who Have Sex With Men in the EU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738065600,"objectID":"80d0b387afd71da6d0db90d1f3c50ee1","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2025hasselt/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2025hasselt/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["dissemination","keynote talk / seminar"],"title":"Eugenio presenting at Hasselt University","type":"event"},{"authors":["Boxuan Wang (王博玄)"],"categories":null,"content":"A new study assessing PrEP policies across countries in the European Union will soon be out.

This case study explores how colocation and open mobility data from Meta can ultimately enhance the estimation of the reproduction ratio, which informs public health decision makers about the average number of people who will become infected from contact with an originally infected person. Sorbonne Université, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) and the Department of Applied Science and Technology (DISAT) at Politecnico di Torino, are leading academic institutions dedicated to advancing scientific research and technological innovation. A team of modelers working across these institutions have been developing data-rich mathematical models to study how infectious diseases spread in human and animal populations. This modeling team reached out to Meta’s Data for Good team to access large-scale mobility data that could improve modeling for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.\nChallenges: The research team’s work addresses the problem of estimating the reproduction ratio of an infectious disease epidemic, also known as reproductive number, or R. The reproduction ratio is the average number of secondary infections that each case generates, and is a commonly used indicator to monitor and forecast the evolution of an epidemic wave. Accurately estimating R is crucial to inform policies and guide public health interventions. The standard way to estimate the reproduction ratio is to infer it from data from epidemiological surveillance, such as hospitalizations, deaths, testing, or other proxies of infections. However, surveillance data may lead to biased estimates of the reproduction ratio in populations in cities and other geographically distinct communities that are connected through human mobility. Heterogeneities in the contact network shape the way epidemics spread, hiding the true dynamic structure of the epidemic process from population-level surveillance data. Crucially, this means that inferences on surveillance data may either overestimate or underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, misinforming authorities and possibly leading to inappropriate responses.\nUtilizing Meta Data for Good: To tackle this challenge, researchers from the Sorbonne University, INSERM and Polytechnic of Turin devised a methodology for inferring the reproduction ratio by combining surveillance data, census data, and colocation and mobility data from Meta’s Data for Good program. The team primarily used Meta colocation maps, which are calculated from mobile phone data and show the proportion of time that residents of different communities within the same country spend in proximity to one another. These datasets provide precise information on the heterogeneous contact patterns that shape the evolution of an infectious epidemic at subnational resolution. The team also used Meta’s open source Movement Range Maps for additional validation and corrections to their modeling. Meta colocation data, together with census data, allowed the team to reconstruct a reproduction operator that reveals the average number of secondary cases each infected individual produces, depending on the region of residence of both the infectious carrier and the newly infected person. After reconstructing the reproduction operator, the research team can evaluate the bias in estimates of the reproduction ratio obtained from population-level surveillance data. Leveraging Meta colocation data to measure close-proximity contact rates within and between communities, the new method can infer the reproduction ratio using only surveillance data with no need to parametrize complex mathematical models describing individual behavior.\nComparison of the reference and measured reproduction ratios. From Fig. 2 of Birello et al, 2024 Nat Phys - see Additional resources below Results and Impact: The research team applied their new corrected reproduction ratio retrospectively to the COVID-19 epidemic in France, focusing on the months of January and February 2021. Crucially, this correction suggested that traditional surveillance estimates consistently under-estimated the reproduction ratio during that period, suggesting a subsiding epidemic wave. This estimate was at odds with the actual events, which showcased a growing epidemic wave - ultimately known as the third French wave - and led to the national lockdown enforced on April 3, 2021. The corrected reproduction ratio, on the other hand, would have consistently signaled a growing epidemic wave throughout the first three months of the year. These findings are highly relevant to the debate over the public health response in France at the time. It is conceivable that the underestimation of the third wave’s severity by …","date":1724630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724630400,"objectID":"2f210f6da43ffec450949efe1790eb13","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/post/2024rt-meta/","publishdate":"2024-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024rt-meta/","section":"post","summary":"A collaboration between Meta (Data for Good) and EV / The Modelers.\n","tags":null,"title":"Leveraging open mobility data from Meta to correct underestimations in disease spread.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Laura Di Domenico","Eugenio Valdano","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718064000,"objectID":"f1a7ecab9907e2e01e57a2cb7e9a4363","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/24dedlim/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/24dedlim/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditional disease transmission models assume that the infectious period is exponentially distributed with a recovery rate fixed in time and across individuals. This assumption provides analytical and computational advantages, however, it is often unrealistic when compared to empirical data. Current efforts in modeling nonexponentially distributed infectious periods are either limited to special cases or lead to unsolvable models. Also, the link between empirical data (the infectious period distribution) and the modeling needs (the definition of the corresponding recovery rates) lacks a clear understanding. Here we introduce a mapping of an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods into a distribution of recovery rates. Under the Markovian assumption to ensure analytical tractability, we show that the same infectious period distribution at the population level can be reproduced by two modeling schemes that we call host-based and population-based, depending on the individual response to the infection, and aggregated empirical data cannot easily discriminate the correct scheme. Besides being conceptually different, the two schemes also lead to different epidemic trajectories. Although sharing the same behavior close to the disease-free equilibrium, the host-based scheme deviates from the expected epidemic when reaching the endemic equilibrium of a susceptible-infectious-susceptible transmission model, while the population-based scheme turns out to be equivalent to assuming a homogeneous recovery rate. We show this through analytical computations and stochastic epidemic simulations on a contact network, using both generative network models and empirical contact data. It is therefore possible to reproduce heterogeneous infectious periods in network-based transmission models, however, the resulting prevalence is sensitive to the modeling choice for the interpretation of the empirically collected data on the length of the infectious period. In the absence of higher resolution data, studies should acknowledge such deviations in the epidemic predictions.

Consequently, surveillance may underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, even mistaking growing epidemics as subsiding. To address this, we use the spectral properties of the matrix describing the spatial epidemic spread to reweight surveillance data. We propose a correction that removes the bias across all epidemic phases. We validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 as a case study. However, our results apply to any epidemic in which mobility is a driver of circulation.

Now, vaccination campaigns are focusing on booster doses, and primary vaccinations have all but halted. Still, 52 million European adults are unvaccinated. We investigated if reaching the still unvaccinated population in future vaccination campaigns would substantially decrease the current burden of COVID-19, which is substantial. We focused on vaccination homophily, whereby those who are unvaccinated are mostly in contact with other unvaccinated, making COVID-19 circulation easier. We quantified vaccination homophily and estimated its impact on COVID-19 circulation.\nWe used an online survey of 1,055,286 people from 22 European countries during early 2022. We computed vaccination homophily as the association between reported vaccination status and perceived vaccination uptake among one’s own social contacts, using a case-referent design and a hierarchical logistic model. We used this information in an analysis of the COVID-19 reproduction ratio to determine the impact of vaccine homophily in transmission.\nVaccination homophily was present and strong everywhere: the average odds ratio of being vaccinated for a 10-percentage-point increase in coverage among contacts was 1.66 (95% CI=(1.60, 1.72)). Homophily was positively associated with the strictness of COVID-19-related restrictions in 2020 (Pearson=0.49, p-value=0.03). In the countries studied, 12%-to-18% of the reproduction ratio would be attributable to vaccine homophily.\nReducing vaccination homophily may curb the reproduction ratio substantially even to the point of preventing recurrent epidemic waves. In addition to boosting those already vaccinated, increasing primary vaccination should remain a high priority in future vaccination campaigns, to reduce vaccination homophily: this combined strategy may decrease COVID-19 burden.

But it also revealed that current models may not fully exploit the high-resolution data on disease progression, epidemic surveillance and host behavior, now available. Take the epidemic threshold, which quantifies the spreading risk throughout epidemic emergence, mitigation, and control. Its use requires oversimplifying either disease or host contact dynamics. We introduce the epidemic graph diagrams to overcome this by computing the epidemic threshold directly from arbitrarily complex data on contacts, disease and interventions. A grammar of diagram operations allows to decompose, compare, simplify models with computational efficiency, extracting theoretical understanding. We use the diagrams to explain the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the 2007–2008 season, and demonstrate that neglecting non-infectious prodromic stages of sexually transmitted infections biases the predicted epidemic risk, compromising control. The diagrams are general, and improve our capacity to respond to present and future public health challenges.","tags":null,"title":"Epidemic graph diagrams as analytics for epidemic control in the data-rich era","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"Those who cannot attend in person may attend online using this link.\nAmanda Perofsky’s website.\n","date":1700744400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700744400,"objectID":"e2aba87a5ee2614227e89035d83f4784","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2023perofsky/","publishdate":"2023-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2023perofsky/","section":"event","summary":"Those who cannot attend in person may attend online using this link.\nAmanda Perofsky’s website.","tags":["guest talk"],"title":"Seminar by Amanda Perofsky, University of Washington","type":"event"},{"authors":["Suprabhath Kalahasti"],"categories":null,"content":"Suprabhath starts his PhD in Epidemiology and public health at our group.\n","date":1700438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700438400,"objectID":"881d4f5778e86cf2cf078024962f1a11","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2023suprabhath/","publishdate":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2023suprabhath/","section":"event","summary":"Suprabhath starts his PhD in Epidemiology and public health at our group.","tags":["announcement"],"title":"Welcome Suprabhath!","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Claudio Ascione","Boxuan Wang (王博玄)"],"categories":null,"content":"We will be at a 2-day retreat of our institute: the Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health.\n","date":1699315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699315200,"objectID":"2eb91524c620d3f14ba24b020ba558ac","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2023iplespretreat/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2023iplespretreat/","section":"event","summary":"We will be at a 2-day retreat of our institute: the Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health.","tags":["event"],"title":"IPLESP retreat","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Claudio Ascione","Boxuan Wang (王博玄)"],"categories":null,"content":"We will be attending the annual meeting of the Consortium Infectious Disease Modeling - French: Action Coordonnée Modélisation des maladies infectieuses (AC Modélisation) -, of which Eugenio is a member of the Scientific Committee.

For these epidemics to develop, populations need to be mobile. However, the role of population-level mobility in the development of generalized HIV epidemics has not been studied. Here we do so by studying historical migration data from Botswana, which has one of the most severe generalized HIV epidemics worldwide; HIV prevalence was 21% in 2021. The country reported its first AIDS case in 1985 when it began to rapidly urbanize. We hypothesize that, during the development of Botswana's epidemic, the population was extremely mobile and the country was highly connected by substantial migratory flows. We test this mobility hypothesis by conducting a network analysis using a historical time series (1981-2011) of micro-census data from Botswana. Our results support our hypothesis. We found complex migration networks with very high rates of rural-to-urban, and urban-to-rural, migration: 10% of the population moved annually. Mining towns (where AIDS cases were first reported, and risk behavior was high) were important in-flow and out-flow migration hubs, suggesting that they functioned as 'core groups' for HIV transmission and dissemination. Migration networks could have dispersed HIV throughout Botswana and generated the current hyperendemic epidemic.","tags":[],"title":"The role of migration networks in the development of Botswana's generalized HIV epidemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689246000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689246000,"objectID":"b21f27f8c947fd21a7ff72cdb5c90dfb","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2023netsci/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2023netsci/","section":"event","summary":"Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting.","tags":["dissemination","contributed talk"],"title":"Lightning talk at NetSci","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"We are organizing the second edition of this satellite meeting together with Mattia Mazzoli and Giulia Pullano and Chiara Sabbatini.

Check out the event website.\nHuman mobility is a driver of epidemics. Long-range movements drive patterns of pathogen importation and exportation. Short-range mobility fuels local epidemics, by tuning population mixing and transmission rates. This is why the study of patterns of human mobility can tell us why and how epidemics break out and circulate, and inform us on effective prevention and control policies. The current COVID-19 pandemic is proof of this potential.\nIn the last decades, mobility data coming mostly from mobile devices (phones, smartphones) have informed epidemiological studies: e.g., malaria, cholera, Ebola. But, during this pandemic, we witnessed a data-sharing revolution in which network operators such as Orange, Vodafone, Telefonica, and companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Cuebiq, SafeGraph, Unacast, started providing their aggregated mobility data extracted from mobile phone traces in real-time. This new resource is, however, also a challenge. Epidemiological research is in the process of developing new tools, and models, to integrate these data and use them both for retrospective analysis of epidemic dynamics, and for active surveillance and epidemic monitoring, at higher spatial resolution than ever before.\n​The satellite aims at gathering researchers working on the use of mobility data for the study of, and response to, infectious disease epidemics.

However, widespread pandemic fatigue and limited compliance potentially undermine mitigation efforts. **Methods** To establish a baseline for interventions, we ran a multicountry survey to assess respondents’ willingness to receive booster vaccination and comply with testing and isolation mandates. Integrating survey and estimated immunity data in a branching process epidemic spreading model, we evaluated the effectiveness and costs of current protocols in France, Belgium, and Italy to manage the winter wave. **Findings** The vast majority of survey participants (N = 4594) was willing to adhere to testing (\u003e91%) and rapid isolation (\u003e88%) across the three countries. Pronounced differences emerged in the declared senior adherence to booster vaccination (73% in France, 94% in Belgium, 86% in Italy). Epidemic model results estimate that testing and isolation protocols would confer significant benefit in reducing transmission (17–24% reduction, from R = 1.6 to R = 1.3 in France and Belgium, to R = 1.2 in Italy) with declared adherence. Achieving a mitigating level similar to the French protocol, the Belgian protocol would require 35% fewer tests (from 1 test to 0.65 test per infected person) and avoid the long isolation periods of the Italian protocol (average of 6 days vs. 11). A cost barrier to test would significantly decrease adherence in France and Belgium, undermining protocols’ effectiveness. **Interpretation** Simpler mandates for isolation may increase awareness and actual compliance, reducing testing costs, without compromising mitigation. High booster vaccination uptake remains key for the control of the winter wave.","tags":null,"title":"Attitudes towards booster, testing and isolation, and their impact on COVID-19 response in winter 2022/2023 in France, Belgium, and Italy: a cross-sectional survey and modelling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673258400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673258400,"objectID":"783d1ee256fcdd042ddadb0bf07e2e4c","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2023isi/","publishdate":"2023-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2023isi/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["dissemination","keynote talk / seminar"],"title":"Seminar at the ISI Foundation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":["announcement"],"content":"Are you interested in applying machine learning to public health?

Empirically measured networks and dynamic processes that take place in these situations show heterogeneous, non-Markovian, and intrinsically correlated topologies and dynamics. This makes their analysis particularly challenging. Randomized reference models (RRMs) have emerged as a general and versatile toolbox for studying such systems. Defined as random networks with given features constrained to match those of an input (empirical) network, they may, for example, be used to identify important features of empirical networks and their effects on dynamical processes unfolding in the network. RRMs are typically implemented as procedures that reshuffle an empirical network, making them very generally applicable. However, the effects of most shuffling procedures on network features remain poorly understood, rendering their use nontrivial and susceptible to misinterpretation. Here we propose a unified framework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs) that sample networks with uniform probability. Focusing on temporal networks, we survey applications of MRRMs found in the literature, and we use this framework to build a taxonomy of MRRMs that proposes a canonical naming convention, classifies them, and deduces their effects on a range of important network features. We furthermore show that certain classes of MRRMs may be applied in sequential composition to generate new MRRMs from the existing ones surveyed in this article. We finally provide a tutorial showing how to apply a series of MRRMs to analyze how different network features affect a dynamic process in an empirical temporal network. Our taxonomy provides a reference for the use of MRRMs, and the theoretical foundations laid here may further serve as a base for the development of a principled and automatized way to generate and apply randomized reference models for the study of networked systems.","tags":null,"title":"Randomized Reference Models for Temporal Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Piero Birello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666003500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666003500,"objectID":"f34362814be7ef4a25613f48580ae0f4","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2022ccs1/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022ccs1/","section":"event","summary":"Surveillance-based estimates of the reproductive number may be biased in spatially structured populations.","tags":["dissemination","contributed talk"],"title":"Contributed talk at CCS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666003500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666003500,"objectID":"44eec5a999df061a31af259b25b52dff","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/event/2022ccs2/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022ccs2/","section":"event","summary":"Optimal distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis may not be risk-based.","tags":["dissemination","contributed talk"],"title":"Contributed talk at CCS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"I will be a keynote speaker at this satellite.

Well-established theory recommends prioritizing those at highest risk of exposure. But risk is hard to estimate, especially for diseases involving stigma and marginalization. We address this conundrum by proving that one should target those at high risk only if the infection-averting efficacy of prevention is above a critical value, which we derive analytically. We apply this to the distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among men-having-sex-with-men (MSM), a population particularly vulnerable to HIV. PrEP is effective in averting infections, but its global scale-up has been slow, showing the need to revisit distribution strategies, currently risk-based. Using data from MSM communities in 58 countries, we find that non-selective PrEP distribution often outperforms risk-based, showing that a logistically simpler strategy is also more effective. Our theory may help design more feasible and successful prevention.","tags":["featured"],"title":"Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"I am organizing this satellite meeting together with Mattia Mazzoli and Giulia Pullano.

There is considerable travel linking urban and rural areas.Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission models have been fairly accurate in their predictions for resource-rich countries, models have tended to be very inaccurate in their predictions for Africa.1,2 We propose that one important reason for this inaccuracy is that the structure of the current models does not consider the spatial demography of African countries.

We hypothesise that the migratory behaviour of the general population of countries in sub-Saharan Africa could have a substantial effect on HIV epidemics and challenge the elimination effort. To test this hypothesis, we used census data from 2017 to identify, construct, and visualise the migration network of the population of Botswana, which has one of the most severe HIV epidemics worldwide. We found that, over 12 months, approximately 14% of the population moved their residency from one district to another. Four types of migration occurred: urban-to-urban, rural-to-urban, urban-to-rural, and rural-to-rural. Migration is leading to a marked geographical redistribution of the population, causing high rates of population turnover in some areas, and further concentrating the population in urban areas. The migration network could potentially be having a substantial effect on the HIV epidemic of Botswana: changing the location of high-transmission areas, generating cross-country transmission corridors, creating source–sink dynamics, and undermining control strategies. Large-scale migration networks could present a considerable challenge to eliminating HIV in Botswana and in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and should be considered when designing epidemic control strategies.","tags":[],"title":"The potential impact of country-level migration networks on HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Botswana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zachary Susswein","Eugenio Valdano","Tobias Brett","Pejman Rohani","Vittoria Colizza","Shweta Bansal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634428800,"objectID":"f4020fa1fd18ebbfb535722d162a22c6","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/21susign/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/21susign/","section":"publication","summary":"To dissect the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, we integrate parallel streams of high-resolution data on contact, mobility, seasonality, vaccination and seroprevalence within a metapopulation network.

However, involving a strong perturbation of daily life, it often causes psychosocial distress, and severe financial and social costs. These may act as mechanisms limiting the adoption of the measure in the first place or the adherence throughout its full duration. In addition, difficulty of recognizing mild symptoms or lack of symptoms may impact awareness of the infection and further limit adoption. Here we study an epidemic model on a network of contacts accounting for limited adherence and delayed awareness to self-isolation, along with fatigue causing overhasty termination. The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and analyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation. We find that the epidemic threshold is very sensitive to an effective compliance that combines the effects of imperfect adherence, delayed awareness and fatigue. If adherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal duration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However, heterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance for highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness of self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of delayed awareness and fatigue on the efficacy of self-isolation in epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Mazzoli","Eugenio Valdano","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"e3c386e40f54854af7881f33dfb7539d","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/21mazpro/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/21mazpro/","section":"publication","summary":"France's COVID-19 epidemic situation is at a turning point.

Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6–8%) to 38% (35–44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave.","tags":[],"title":"Underdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Nicola Scarpa","Stefania Rubrichi","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"75f974f73bb3897d04f10d35cffd7c29","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/20puleva/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20puleva/","section":"publication","summary":"BackgroundOn March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care. Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities.MethodsFor this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18–64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours.FindingsLockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585 000 to 117 000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown).InterpretationLockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the effect of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and risk aversion on mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown: a population-based study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Pinotti","Laura Di Domenico","Ernesto Ortega","Marco Mancastroppa","Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Pierre-Yves Boëlle","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"99fe7e7de076dbf2cc7ce02b0df94daa","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/20pintra/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20pintra/","section":"publication","summary":"Background In the early months of 2020, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly from China across multiple countries worldwide. As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 ± 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 ± 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.","tags":["Asia","China","COVID 19","Epidemiology","Infectious disease control","Italy","Pandemics","SARS CoV 2"],"title":"Tracing and analysis of 288 early SARS-CoV-2 infections outside China: A modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin T.

Mobility-driven transmission can result in source–sink dynamics: one community can sustain a micro-epidemic in another community in which transmission is too low to be self-sustaining. In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$) is used to specify the sustainability threshold. \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ represents the average number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual in a community in which everyone is susceptible.

Here, we discuss the conditions that are needed (in terms of \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$) for source–sink transmission dynamics to occur in generalised HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, present an example of where these conditions could occur (ie, Namibia), and discuss the necessity of considering mobility-driven transmission when designing control strategies.

Here we analyze how network dynamics shapes the outcome of the competition between an initially endemic strain and an emerging one, when both strains follow a susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics, and spread at time scales comparable with the network evolution one. Using time-resolved data of close-proximity interactions between patients admitted to a hospital and medical health care workers, we analyze the impact of temporal patterns and initial conditions on the dominance diagram and coexistence time. We find that strong variations in activity volume cause the probability that the emerging strain replaces the endemic one to be highly sensitive to the time of emergence. The temporal structure of the network shapes the dominance diagram, with significant variations in the replacement probability (for a given set of epidemiological parameters) observed from the empirical network and a randomized version of it.

This puts sex workers at higher risk of infection even in populations where HIV prevalence is moderate or low. Alongside condom use, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for sex workers to reduce their risk of HIV acquisition. However, PrEP provides no direct protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV, unlike condoms. We use an empirical network of sexual contacts among female sex workers (FSWs) and clients to simulate the spread of HIV and gonorrhea. We then investigate the effect of PrEP adoption and adherence, on both HIV and gonorrhea prevalence. We also study the effect of a potential increase in condomless acts due to lowered risk perception with respect of the no-PrEP scenario (risk compensation). We find that when HIV is the only disease circulating, PrEP is effective in reducing HIV prevalence, even with high risk compensation. Instead, the complex interplay between the two diseases shows that different levels of risk compensation require different intervention strategies. Finally, we find that providing PrEP only to the most active FSWs is less effective than uniform PrEP adoption.

As a result, they are the key driver of the persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal, however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their displacement throughout the country due to trade transactions, is still missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within-herd infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. We use our model to study the role of the different productive contexts of the Italian market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market for which cattle movement data is available.","tags":["BVD","Cattle trade movements","Metapopulation model","Productive classes","Targeted intervention"],"title":"Farm productive contexts and the dynamics of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Susanna Manrubia","Sergio Gómez","Alex Arenas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"60df3ede7ebb83c1ea4ff37bb4f47a10","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/19valend/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19valend/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","tags":["Extinct genomes","Genomics","Host-pathogen interactions","Viral evolution","Viral persistence and latency","Viral replication","Viral structure","Virions"],"title":"Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Darbon","Davide Colombi","Eugenio Valdano","Lara Savini","Armando Giovannini","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ad3e47acf71906b47d6e18c7670986f2","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/19dardis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19dardis/","section":"publication","summary":"The infectious period of a transmissible disease is a key factor for disease spread and persistence. Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is, however, often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host–pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here, we consider a susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts—the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parametrization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.","tags":["epidemic spread","epidemic threshold","mathematical modelling","susceptible-infectious-susceptible model","temporal network"],"title":"Disease persistence on temporal contact networks accounting for heterogeneous infectious periods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Darbon","Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Armando Giovannini","Lara Savini","Luca Candeloro","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"aaaed2ea7d4eff2a0599ff5b5eaefe0b","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/18darnetbas/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18darnetbas/","section":"publication","summary":"The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility, increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85, p{\textbackslash}textless10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4, p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56, p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.","tags":["Animal trade","Brucellosis","Epidemic model","Networks","Vulnerability"],"title":"Network-based assessment of the vulnerability of Italian regions to bovine brucellosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Michele Re Fiorentin","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"b90740d779180b2c434732b988c3228e","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/18valepi/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18valepi/","section":"publication","summary":"Current understanding of the critical outbreak condition on temporal networks relies on approximations (time scale separation, discretization) that may bias the results.

Complete coverage of the contacts occurring in a population is however generally unattainable, due for instance to limited participation rates or experimental constraints in spatial coverage. Here, we study the impact of spatially constrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a population using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is quantified by the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of communicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility above which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and empirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due to spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias is however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same fraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that are recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover, it depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading dynamics.","tags":["disease spreading","Network epidemiology","network sampling"],"title":"Impact of spatially constrained sampling of temporal contact networks on the evaluation of the epidemic risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"40d33fb8db55107604f46926d1998203","permalink":"https://www.evmodelers.org/publication/15valinf/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/15valinf/","section":"publication","summary":"The epidemic threshold of a spreading process indicates the condition for the occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the network vulnerability to the epidemic.

PRX 2015) for a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, we formulate here an infection propagator approach to compute the epidemic threshold accounting for more realistic effects regarding a varying force of infection per contact, the presence of immunity, and a limited time resolution of the temporal network. We apply the approach to two temporal network models and an empirical dataset of school contacts. We find that permanent or temporary immunity do not affect the estimation of the epidemic threshold through the infection propagator approach. Comparisons with numerical results show the good agreement of the analytical predictions. Aggregating the temporal network rapidly deteriorates the predictions, except for slow diseases once the heterogeneity of the links is preserved.

This can be achieved by identifying the elements at higher risk of infection and implementing targeted surveillance and control measures. One important ingredient to consider is the pattern of disease-transmission contacts among the elements, however lack of data or delays in providing updated records may hinder its use, especially for time-varying patterns. Here we explore to what extent it is possible to use past temporal data of a system's pattern of contacts to predict the risk of infection of its elements during an emerging outbreak, in absence of updated data. We focus on two real-world temporal systems; a livestock displacements trade network among animal holdings, and a network of sexual encounters in high-end prostitution. We define the node's loyalty as a local measure of its tendency to maintain contacts with the same elements over time, and uncover important non-trivial correlations with the node's epidemic risk. We show that a risk assessment analysis incorporating this knowledge and based on past structural and temporal pattern properties provides accurate predictions for both systems. Its generalizability is tested by introducing a theoretical model for generating synthetic temporal networks. High accuracy of our predictions is recovered across different settings, while the amount of possible predictions is system-specific. The proposed method can provide crucial information for the setup of targeted intervention strategies.","tags":["Cattle","Epidemiology","Infectious disease epidemiology","Livestock","Medical risk factors","Probability distribution","Veterinary diseases","Veterinary epidemiology"],"title":"Predicting Epidemic Risk from Past Temporal Contact Data","type":"publication"}]
