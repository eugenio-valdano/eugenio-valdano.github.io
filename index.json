There is considerable travel linking urban and rural areas.Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission models have been fairly accurate in their predictions for resource-rich countries, models have tended to be very inaccurate in their predictions for Africa.1,2 We propose that one important reason for this inaccuracy is that the structure of the current models does not consider the spatial demography of African countries.

We hypothesise that the migratory behaviour of the general population of countries in sub-Saharan Africa could have a substantial effect on HIV epidemics and challenge the elimination effort. To test this hypothesis, we used census data from 2017 to identify, construct, and visualise the migration network of the population of Botswana, which has one of the most severe HIV epidemics worldwide. We found that, over 12 months, approximately 14% of the population moved their residency from one district to another. Four types of migration occurred: urban-to-urban, rural-to-urban, urban-to-rural, and rural-to-rural. Migration is leading to a marked geographical redistribution of the population, causing high rates of population turnover in some areas, and further concentrating the population in urban areas. The migration network could potentially be having a substantial effect on the HIV epidemic of Botswana: changing the location of high-transmission areas, generating cross-country transmission corridors, creating source–sink dynamics, and undermining control strategies. Large-scale migration networks could present a considerable challenge to eliminating HIV in Botswana and in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and should be considered when designing epidemic control strategies.","tags":[],"title":"The potential impact of country-level migration networks on HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Botswana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia De Meijere","Vittoria Colizza","Eugenio Valdano","Claudio Castellano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"f6260a4438d3d177c9c5928357839201","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/demeieff21/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/demeieff21/","section":"publication","summary":"The isolation of infectious individuals is a key measure of public health for the control of communicable diseases. However, involving a strong perturbation of daily life, it often causes psychosocial distress, and severe financial and social costs. These may act as mechanisms limiting the adoption of the measure in the first place or the adherence throughout its full duration. In addition, difficulty of recognizing mild symptoms or lack of symptoms may impact awareness of the infection and further limit adoption. Here we study an epidemic model on a network of contacts accounting for limited adherence and delayed awareness to self-isolation, along with fatigue causing overhasty termination. The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and analyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation. We find that the epidemic threshold is very sensitive to an effective compliance that combines the effects of imperfect adherence, delayed awareness and fatigue. If adherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal duration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However, heterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance for highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness of self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of delayed awareness and fatigue on the efficacy of self-isolation in epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Mazzoli","Eugenio Valdano","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"3c15819c0bd21f5666b0f5ec2c0e89ed","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/mazpro21/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mazpro21/","section":"publication","summary":"France's COVID-19 epidemic situation is at a turning point.

Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6–8%) to 38% (35–44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave.","tags":[],"title":"Underdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Nicola Scarpa","Stefania Rubrichi","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"ff5749b7409c598f317c537f2f73c279","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/puleva20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puleva20/","section":"publication","summary":"BackgroundOn March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care. Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities.MethodsFor this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18–64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours.FindingsLockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585 000 to 117 000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown).InterpretationLockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the effect of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and risk aversion on mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown: a population-based study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Pinotti","Laura Di Domenico","Ernesto Ortega","Marco Mancastroppa","Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Pierre-Yves Boëlle","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"d370d255596e0e199ddcd7f724cb9b72","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/pintra20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pintra20/","section":"publication","summary":"Background In the early months of 2020, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly from China across multiple countries worldwide. As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 ± 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 ± 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.","tags":["Asia","China","COVID 19","Epidemiology","Infectious disease control","Italy","Pandemics","SARS CoV 2"],"title":"Tracing and analysis of 288 early SARS-CoV-2 infections outside China: A modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin T.

Mobility-driven transmission can result in source–sink dynamics: one community can sustain a micro-epidemic in another community in which transmission is too low to be self-sustaining. In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$) is used to specify the sustainability threshold. \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ represents the average number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual in a community in which everyone is susceptible. If \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ is greater than 1, transmission is high enough to sustain an epidemic; if \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ is less than 1, it is not. Here, we discuss the conditions that are needed (in terms of \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$) for source–sink transmission dynamics to occur in generalised HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, present an example of where these conditions could occur (ie, Namibia), and discuss the necessity of considering mobility-driven transmission when designing control strategies. Additionally, we discuss the need for a new generation of HIV transmission models that are more realistic than the current models.

The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.MethodsWe used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.FindingsCountries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.InterpretationMany countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.","tags":[],"title":"Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Pullano","Francesco Pinotti","Eugenio Valdano","Pierre-Yves Boëlle","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"3b039884598d15aa4a6b6dfa03e4a7b0","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/pulnov20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pulnov20/","section":"publication","summary":"As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China.

This puts sex workers at higher risk of infection even in populations where HIV prevalence is moderate or low. Alongside condom use, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for sex workers to reduce their risk of HIV acquisition. However, PrEP provides no direct protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV, unlike condoms. We use an empirical network of sexual contacts among female sex workers (FSWs) and clients to simulate the spread of HIV and gonorrhea. We then investigate the effect of PrEP adoption and adherence, on both HIV and gonorrhea prevalence. We also study the effect of a potential increase in condomless acts due to lowered risk perception with respect of the no-PrEP scenario (risk compensation). We find that when HIV is the only disease circulating, PrEP is effective in reducing HIV prevalence, even with high risk compensation. Instead, the complex interplay between the two diseases shows that different levels of risk compensation require different intervention strategies. Finally, we find that providing PrEP only to the most active FSWs is less effective than uniform PrEP adoption. Our work shows that the effects emerging from the complex interactions between these diseases and the available prophylactic measures need to be accounted for, to devise effective intervention strategies.","tags":["Physics - Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution"],"title":"Evaluating the impact of PrEP on HIV and gonorrhea on a networked population of female sex workers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bryan Iotti","Eugenio Valdano","Lara Savini","Luca Candeloro","Armando Giovannini","Sergio Rosati","Vittoria Colizza","Mario Giacobini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"553473c54e591010bc456982f919d08e","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/iotfar19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iotfar19/","section":"publication","summary":"Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a viral disease that affects cattle and that is endemic to many European countries. It has a markedly negative impact on the economy, through reduced milk production, abortions, and a shorter lifespan of the infected animals. Cows becoming infected during gestation may give birth to Persistently Infected (PI) calves, which remain highly infective throughout their life, due to the lack of immune response to the virus. As a result, they are the key driver of the persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal, however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their displacement throughout the country due to trade transactions, is still missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within-herd infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. We use our model to study the role of the different productive contexts of the Italian market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market for which cattle movement data is available.","tags":["BVD","Cattle trade movements","Metapopulation model","Productive classes","Targeted intervention"],"title":"Farm productive contexts and the dynamics of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Susanna Manrubia","Sergio Gómez","Alex Arenas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"ccdf119394eec4c7d88da658efcc163b","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valend19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valend19/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","tags":["Extinct genomes","Genomics","Host-pathogen interactions","Viral evolution","Viral persistence and latency","Viral replication","Viral structure","Virions"],"title":"Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is, however, often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host–pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here, we consider a susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts—the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parametrization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.","tags":["epidemic spread","epidemic threshold","mathematical modelling","susceptible-infectious-susceptible model","temporal network"],"title":"Disease persistence on temporal contact networks accounting for heterogeneous infectious periods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Darbon","Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Armando Giovannini","Lara Savini","Luca Candeloro","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"80f459653d94a9aec27c6ec2178e9501","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/darnetbas18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/darnetbas18/","section":"publication","summary":"The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility, increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85, p{\textbackslash}textless10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4, p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56, p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.","tags":["Animal trade","Brucellosis","Epidemic model","Networks","Vulnerability"],"title":"Network-based assessment of the vulnerability of Italian regions to bovine brucellosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Michele Re Fiorentin","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"c6d653e8f23df8971f59558cce54476a","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valepi18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valepi18/","section":"publication","summary":"Current understanding of the critical outbreak condition on temporal networks relies on approximations (time scale separation, discretization) that may bias the results.

Here, we study the impact of spatially constrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a population using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is quantified by the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of communicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility above which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and empirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due to spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias is however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same fraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that are recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover, it depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading dynamics.","tags":["disease spreading","Network epidemiology","network sampling"],"title":"Impact of spatially constrained sampling of temporal contact networks on the evaluation of the epidemic risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"ad14dda170e8543d7373ba72630183ba","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valinf15/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valinf15/","section":"publication","summary":"The epidemic threshold of a spreading process indicates the condition for the occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the network vulnerability to the epidemic.

This can be achieved by identifying the elements at higher risk of infection and implementing targeted surveillance and control measures. One important ingredient to consider is the pattern of disease-transmission contacts among the elements, however lack of data or delays in providing updated records may hinder its use, especially for time-varying patterns. Here we explore to what extent it is possible to use past temporal data of a system's pattern of contacts to predict the risk of infection of its elements during an emerging outbreak, in absence of updated data. We focus on two real-world temporal systems; a livestock displacements trade network among animal holdings, and a network of sexual encounters in high-end prostitution. We define the node's loyalty as a local measure of its tendency to maintain contacts with the same elements over time, and uncover important non-trivial correlations with the node's epidemic risk. We show that a risk assessment analysis incorporating this knowledge and based on past structural and temporal pattern properties provides accurate predictions for both systems. Its generalizability is tested by introducing a theoretical model for generating synthetic temporal networks. High accuracy of our predictions is recovered across different settings, while the amount of possible predictions is system-specific. The proposed method can provide crucial information for the setup of targeted intervention strategies.","tags":["Cattle","Epidemiology","Infectious disease epidemiology","Livestock","Medical risk factors","Probability distribution","Veterinary diseases","Veterinary epidemiology"],"title":"Predicting Epidemic Risk from Past Temporal Contact Data","type":"publication"}]
