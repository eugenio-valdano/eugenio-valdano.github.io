Estimates of R routinely come from statistical inference on timelines of cases or their proxies like symptomatic cases, hospitalizatons, deaths. Here, however, we prove that these estimates of R may not be accurate if the population is made up of spatially distinct communities, as the interplay between space and mobility may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. This means that surveillance may underestimate R over long periods, to the point of mistaking a growing epidemic for a subsiding one, misinforming public health response. To overcome this, we propose a correction to be applied to surveillance data that removes this bias and ensures an accurate estimate of R across all epidemic phases. We use COVID-19 as case study; our results, however, apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation, including major challenges of the next decades: respiratory infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, emerging pathogens), vector-borne diseases (arboviruses). Our findings will help set up public health response to these threats, by improving epidemic monitoring and surveillance.

Smoke can traverse vast distances, compromising air quality in unaffected areas and exacerbating chronic respiratory conditions. But smoke may affect the circulation and burden of communicable diseases, too. The disruption in air quality and adherence to safety guidelines can impact the time people spend indoors, and this in turns may increase exposure to airborne pathogens like influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV. However, the quantification of such disruptions and their implications for the transmission of respiratory diseases remain unclear. Here we study the effects of smoke generated by severe wildfires in the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington in September 2020. We assess the impact on human behavior and the potential consequences for the emergence of respiratory diseases. Our findings reveal a significant shift towards indoor activities in counties within Oregon and Washington during wildfires. However, a discernible change in mobility patterns is not evident in California. This discrepancy may arise from the familiarity of Californian residents with wildfires and air quality index alerts, which have become integrated into their daily routines. Consequently, their mobility patterns may be less affected during such incidents compared to individuals in other regions. We then use a deterministic compartmental model of epidemic spread to quantify the impact of the describe behavioral changes on epidemic circulation. We found that counties with disrupted air exhibited higher cumulated and peak incidence of cases compared to unaffected counties, with the exception of California. Additionally, we found that flu-like epidemics – low reproduction ratio and short generation time – are most affected by the behavioral changes under study. Our findings may help improve public health response in a context of larger, more frequent wildfires triggered by climate change.

However, widespread pandemic fatigue and limited compliance potentially undermine mitigation efforts. **Methods** To establish a baseline for interventions, we ran a multicountry survey to assess respondents’ willingness to receive booster vaccination and comply with testing and isolation mandates. Integrating survey and estimated immunity data in a branching process epidemic spreading model, we evaluated the effectiveness and costs of current protocols in France, Belgium, and Italy to manage the winter wave. **Findings** The vast majority of survey participants (N = 4594) was willing to adhere to testing (91%) and rapid isolation (88%) across the three countries. Pronounced differences emerged in the declared senior adherence to booster vaccination (73% in France, 94% in Belgium, 86% in Italy). Epidemic model results estimate that testing and isolation protocols would confer significant benefit in reducing transmission (17–24% reduction, from R = 1.6 to R = 1.3 in France and Belgium, to R = 1.2 in Italy) with declared adherence. Achieving a mitigating level similar to the French protocol, the Belgian protocol would require 35% fewer tests (from 1 test to 0.65 test per infected person) and avoid the long isolation periods of the Italian protocol (average of 6 days vs. 11). A cost barrier to test would significantly decrease adherence in France and Belgium, undermining protocols’ effectiveness. **Interpretation** Simpler mandates for isolation may increase awareness and actual compliance, reducing testing costs, without compromising mitigation. High booster vaccination uptake remains key for the control of the winter wave.","tags":null,"title":"Attitudes towards booster, testing and isolation, and their impact on COVID-19 response in winter 2022/2023 in France, Belgium, and Italy: a cross-sectional survey and modelling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673258400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673258400,"objectID":"783d1ee256fcdd042ddadb0bf07e2e4c","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/talk/seminar-at-the-isi-foundation/","publishdate":"2023-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/seminar-at-the-isi-foundation/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["keynote"],"title":"Seminar at the ISI Foundation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Pierre-Yves Boëlle","Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673222400,"objectID":"2a7d374eb44b01b202383bd7582de62f","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/boethe23/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boethe23/","section":"publication","summary":"In the European Union, mass vaccination against COVID-19 staved off the strict restrictions that had characterized early epidemic response. Now, vaccination campaigns are focusing on booster doses, and primary vaccinations have all but halted. Still, 52 million European adults are unvaccinated. We investigated if reaching the still unvaccinated population in future vaccination campaigns would substantially decrease the current burden of COVID-19, which is substantial. We focused on vaccination homophily, whereby those who are unvaccinated are mostly in contact with other unvaccinated, making COVID-19 circulation easier. We quantified vaccination homophily and estimated its impact on COVID-19 circulation.\nWe used an online survey of 1,055,286 people from 22 European countries during early 2022. We computed vaccination homophily as the association between reported vaccination status and perceived vaccination uptake among one’s own social contacts, using a case-referent design and a hierarchical logistic model. We used this information in an analysis of the COVID-19 reproduction ratio to determine the impact of vaccine homophily in transmission.\nVaccination homophily was present and strong everywhere: the average odds ratio of being vaccinated for a 10-percentage-point increase in coverage among contacts was 1.66 (95% CI=(1.60, 1.72)). Homophily was positively associated with the strictness of COVID-19-related restrictions in 2020 (Pearson=0.49, p-value=0.03). In the countries studied, 12%-to-18% of the reproduction ratio would be attributable to vaccine homophily.\nReducing vaccination homophily may curb the reproduction ratio substantially even to the point of preventing recurrent epidemic waves. In addition to boosting those already vaccinated, increasing primary vaccination should remain a high priority in future vaccination campaigns, to reduce vaccination homophily: this combined strategy may decrease COVID-19 burden.

Empirically measured networks and dynamic processes that take place in these situations show heterogeneous, non-Markovian, and intrinsically correlated topologies and dynamics. This makes their analysis particularly challenging. Randomized reference models (RRMs) have emerged as a general and versatile toolbox for studying such systems. Defined as random networks with given features constrained to match those of an input (empirical) network, they may, for example, be used to identify important features of empirical networks and their effects on dynamical processes unfolding in the network. RRMs are typically implemented as procedures that reshuffle an empirical network, making them very generally applicable. However, the effects of most shuffling procedures on network features remain poorly understood, rendering their use nontrivial and susceptible to misinterpretation. Here we propose a unified framework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs) that sample networks with uniform probability. Focusing on temporal networks, we survey applications of MRRMs found in the literature, and we use this framework to build a taxonomy of MRRMs that proposes a canonical naming convention, classifies them, and deduces their effects on a range of important network features. We furthermore show that certain classes of MRRMs may be applied in sequential composition to generate new MRRMs from the existing ones surveyed in this article. We finally provide a tutorial showing how to apply a series of MRRMs to analyze how different network features affect a dynamic process in an empirical temporal network. Our taxonomy provides a reference for the use of MRRMs, and the theoretical foundations laid here may further serve as a base for the development of a principled and automatized way to generate and apply randomized reference models for the study of networked systems.","tags":null,"title":"Randomized Reference Models for Temporal Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Piero Birello","Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666003500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666003500,"objectID":"f34362814be7ef4a25613f48580ae0f4","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/talk/contributed-talk-at-ccs/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/contributed-talk-at-ccs/","section":"event","summary":"Surveillance-based estimates of the reproductive number may be biased in spatially structured populations.","tags":["contributed talk"],"title":"Contributed talk at CCS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666003500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666003500,"objectID":"44eec5a999df061a31af259b25b52dff","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/talk/contributed-talk-at-ccs/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/contributed-talk-at-ccs/","section":"event","summary":"Optimal distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis may not be risk-based.","tags":["contributed talk"],"title":"Contributed talk at CCS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"I will be a keynote speaker at this satellite.

But it also exposed fundamental methodological challenges. As high-resolution data on disease progression, epidemic surveillance, and host behavior are now available, can models turn them into accurate epidemic estimates and reliable public health recommendations? Take the epidemic threshold, which estimates the potential for an infection to spread in a host population, quantifying epidemic risk throughout epidemic emergence, mitigation, and control. While models increasingly integrated realistic host contacts, no parallel development occurred with matching detail in disease progression and interventions. This narrowed the use of the epidemic threshold to oversimplified disease and control descriptions. Here, we introduce the epidemic graph diagrams (EGDs), novel representations to compute the epidemic threshold directly from arbitrarily complex data on contacts, disease and control efforts. We define a grammar of diagram operations to decompose, compare, simplify models, extracting new theoretical understanding and improving computational efficiency. We test EGDs on two public health challenges, influenza and sexually transmitted infections, to (i) explain the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the 2007-2008 season, and (ii) demonstrate that neglecting non-infectious prodromic stages biases the predicted epidemic risk, compromising control. EGDs are however general, and increase the performance of mathematical modeling to respond to present and future public health challenges.","tags":null,"title":"Epidemic graph diagrams as analytics for epidemic control in the data-rich era","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663149600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663149600,"objectID":"68c72a25e4000d83a910fc27b38ed6db","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/talk/talk-at-pasteur-institute/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-at-pasteur-institute/","section":"event","summary":"Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting.","tags":["keynote"],"title":"Talk at Pasteur Institute","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662374700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662374700,"objectID":"7a7cb1e3f370bfb55e0eb02e784635c1","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/talk/lecture-at-ifisc-summer-school/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lecture-at-ifisc-summer-school/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["lecture"],"title":"Lecture at IFISC Summer School","type":"event"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano"],"categories":null,"content":"I am organizing this satellite meeting together with Mattia Mazzoli and Giulia Pullano.

Well-established theory recommends prioritizing those at highest risk of exposure. But risk is hard to estimate, especially for diseases involving stigma and marginalization. We address this conundrum by proving that one should target those at high risk only if the infection-averting efficacy of prevention is above a critical value, which we derive analytically. We apply this to the distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among men-having-sex-with-men (MSM), a population particularly vulnerable to HIV. PrEP is effective in averting infections, but its global scale-up has been slow, showing the need to revisit distribution strategies, currently risk-based. Using data from MSM communities in 58 countries, we find that non-selective PrEP distribution often outperforms risk-based, showing that a logistically simpler strategy is also more effective. Our theory may help design more feasible and successful prevention.","tags":[],"title":"Non-selective distribution of infectious disease prevention may outperform risk-based targeting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika are viral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.

We found that, over 12 months, approximately 14% of the population moved their residency from one district to another. Four types of migration occurred: urban-to-urban, rural-to-urban, urban-to-rural, and rural-to-rural. Migration is leading to a marked geographical redistribution of the population, causing high rates of population turnover in some areas, and further concentrating the population in urban areas. The migration network could potentially be having a substantial effect on the HIV epidemic of Botswana: changing the location of high-transmission areas, generating cross-country transmission corridors, creating source–sink dynamics, and undermining control strategies.

However, involving a strong perturbation of daily life, it often causes psychosocial distress, and severe financial and social costs. These may act as mechanisms limiting the adoption of the measure in the first place or the adherence throughout its full duration. In addition, difficulty of recognizing mild symptoms or lack of symptoms may impact awareness of the infection and further limit adoption. Here we study an epidemic model on a network of contacts accounting for limited adherence and delayed awareness to self-isolation, along with fatigue causing overhasty termination. The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and analyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation. We find that the epidemic threshold is very sensitive to an effective compliance that combines the effects of imperfect adherence, delayed awareness and fatigue. If adherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal duration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However, heterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance for highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness of self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of delayed awareness and fatigue on the efficacy of self-isolation in epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Mazzoli","Eugenio Valdano","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"3c15819c0bd21f5666b0f5ec2c0e89ed","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/mazpro21/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mazpro21/","section":"publication","summary":"France's COVID-19 epidemic situation is at a turning point.

Through a Susceptible-Colonized-Susceptible transmission model, we found that schedules reorganization reduced HAI risk by 27% (95% confidence interval [24, 29]%) while preserving timeliness, number, and duration of contacts. More than 30% nurse-nurse contacts should be avoided to achieve an equivalent reduction through simple contact removal. Nurse scheduling can be reorganized to break potential chains of transmission and substantially limit HAI risk, while ensuring the timeliness and quality of healthcare services. This calls for including optimization of nurse scheduling practices in programs for infection control in hospitals.","tags":[],"title":"Reorganization of nurse scheduling reduces the risk of healthcare associated infections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Pullano","Laura Di Domenico","Chiara E.

Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6–8%) to 38% (35–44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave.","tags":[],"title":"Underdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Nicola Scarpa","Stefania Rubrichi","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"ff5749b7409c598f317c537f2f73c279","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/puleva20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/puleva20/","section":"publication","summary":"BackgroundOn March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care. Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities.MethodsFor this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18–64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours.FindingsLockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585 000 to 117 000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown).InterpretationLockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the effect of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and risk aversion on mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown: a population-based study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Pinotti","Laura Di Domenico","Ernesto Ortega","Marco Mancastroppa","Giulia Pullano","Eugenio Valdano","Pierre-Yves Boëlle","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"d370d255596e0e199ddcd7f724cb9b72","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/pintra20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pintra20/","section":"publication","summary":"Background In the early months of 2020, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly from China across multiple countries worldwide. As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 ± 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 ± 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.","tags":["Asia","China","COVID 19","Epidemiology","Infectious disease control","Italy","Pandemics","SARS CoV 2"],"title":"Tracing and analysis of 288 early SARS-CoV-2 infections outside China: A modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin T.

Despite a substantial body of research has been developed considering static, time-aggregated networks, it remains a challenge to understand the transmission of concurrent strains when links of the network are created and destroyed over time. Here we analyze how network dynamics shapes the outcome of the competition between an initially endemic strain and an emerging one, when both strains follow a susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics, and spread at time scales comparable with the network evolution one. Using time-resolved data of close-proximity interactions between patients admitted to a hospital and medical health care workers, we analyze the impact of temporal patterns and initial conditions on the dominance diagram and coexistence time. We find that strong variations in activity volume cause the probability that the emerging strain replaces the endemic one to be highly sensitive to the time of emergence. The temporal structure of the network shapes the dominance diagram, with significant variations in the replacement probability (for a given set of epidemiological parameters) observed from the empirical network and a randomized version of it.

This puts sex workers at higher risk of infection even in populations where HIV prevalence is moderate or low. Alongside condom use, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for sex workers to reduce their risk of HIV acquisition. However, PrEP provides no direct protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV, unlike condoms. We use an empirical network of sexual contacts among female sex workers (FSWs) and clients to simulate the spread of HIV and gonorrhea. We then investigate the effect of PrEP adoption and adherence, on both HIV and gonorrhea prevalence. We also study the effect of a potential increase in condomless acts due to lowered risk perception with respect of the no-PrEP scenario (risk compensation). We find that when HIV is the only disease circulating, PrEP is effective in reducing HIV prevalence, even with high risk compensation. Instead, the complex interplay between the two diseases shows that different levels of risk compensation require different intervention strategies. Finally, we find that providing PrEP only to the most active FSWs is less effective than uniform PrEP adoption.

It has a markedly negative impact on the economy, through reduced milk production, abortions, and a shorter lifespan of the infected animals. Cows becoming infected during gestation may give birth to Persistently Infected (PI) calves, which remain highly infective throughout their life, due to the lack of immune response to the virus. As a result, they are the key driver of the persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal, however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their displacement throughout the country due to trade transactions, is still missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within-herd infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. We use our model to study the role of the different productive contexts of the Italian market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market for which cattle movement data is available.","tags":["BVD","Cattle trade movements","Metapopulation model","Productive classes","Targeted intervention"],"title":"Farm productive contexts and the dynamics of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Susanna Manrubia","Sergio Gómez","Alex Arenas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"ccdf119394eec4c7d88da658efcc163b","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valend19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valend19/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","tags":["Extinct genomes","Genomics","Host-pathogen interactions","Viral evolution","Viral persistence and latency","Viral replication","Viral structure","Virions"],"title":"Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is, however, often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host–pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here, we consider a susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts—the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parametrization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.","tags":["epidemic spread","epidemic threshold","mathematical modelling","susceptible-infectious-susceptible model","temporal network"],"title":"Disease persistence on temporal contact networks accounting for heterogeneous infectious periods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Darbon","Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Armando Giovannini","Lara Savini","Luca Candeloro","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"80f459653d94a9aec27c6ec2178e9501","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/darnetbas18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/darnetbas18/","section":"publication","summary":"The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility, increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85, p{\textbackslash}textless10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4, p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56, p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.","tags":["Animal trade","Brucellosis","Epidemic model","Networks","Vulnerability"],"title":"Network-based assessment of the vulnerability of Italian regions to bovine brucellosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Michele Re Fiorentin","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"c6d653e8f23df8971f59558cce54476a","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valepi18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valepi18/","section":"publication","summary":"Current understanding of the critical outbreak condition on temporal networks relies on approximations (time scale separation, discretization) that may bias the results.

Complete coverage of the contacts occurring in a population is however generally unattainable, due for instance to limited participation rates or experimental constraints in spatial coverage. Here, we study the impact of spatially constrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a population using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is quantified by the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of communicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility above which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and empirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due to spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias is however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same fraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that are recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover, it depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading dynamics.","tags":["disease spreading","Network epidemiology","network sampling"],"title":"Impact of spatially constrained sampling of temporal contact networks on the evaluation of the epidemic risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"ad14dda170e8543d7373ba72630183ba","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valinf15/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valinf15/","section":"publication","summary":"The epidemic threshold of a spreading process indicates the condition for the occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the network vulnerability to the epidemic. Such threshold depends on the natural history of the disease and on the pattern of contacts of the network with its time variation. Based on the theoretical framework introduced in (Valdano et al. PRX 2015) for a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, we formulate here an infection propagator approach to compute the epidemic threshold accounting for more realistic effects regarding a varying force of infection per contact, the presence of immunity, and a limited time resolution of the temporal network. We apply the approach to two temporal network models and an empirical dataset of school contacts. We find that permanent or temporary immunity do not affect the estimation of the epidemic threshold through the infection propagator approach. Comparisons with numerical results show the good agreement of the analytical predictions. Aggregating the temporal network rapidly deteriorates the predictions, except for slow diseases once the heterogeneity of the links is preserved. Weight-topology correlations are found to be the critical factor to be preserved to improve accuracy in the prediction.","tags":[],"title":"Infection propagator approach to compute epidemic thresholds on temporal networks: impact of immunity and of limited temporal resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Luca Ferreri","Chiara Poletto","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"This paper was highlighted in Physics.

Despite the great interest in the problem for the physics, applied mathematics, computer science, and epidemiology communities, a full theoretical understanding is still missing and currently limited to the cases where the time-scale separation holds between spreading and network dynamics or to specific temporal network models. We consider a Markov chain description of the susceptible-infectious-susceptible process on an arbitrary temporal network. By adopting a multilayer perspective, we develop a general analytical derivation of the epidemic threshold in terms of the spectral radius of a matrix that encodes both network structure and disease dynamics. The accuracy of the approach is confirmed on a set of temporal models and empirical networks and against numerical results. In addition, we explore how the threshold changes when varying the overall time of observation of the temporal network, so as to provide insights on the optimal time window for data collection of empirical temporal networked systems. Our framework is of both fundamental and practical interest, as it offers novel understanding of the interplay between temporal networks and spreading dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Analytical Computation of the Epidemic Threshold on Temporal Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenio Valdano","Chiara Poletto","Armando Giovannini","Diana Palma","Lara Savini","Vittoria Colizza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"8ed34205f6a120650b1a78bef0da47a1","permalink":"https://www.eugeniovaldano.com/publication/valpre15/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/valpre15/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding how epidemics spread in a system is a crucial step to prevent and control outbreaks, with broad implications on the system's functioning, health, and associated costs. This can be achieved by identifying the elements at higher risk of infection and implementing targeted surveillance and control measures. One important ingredient to consider is the pattern of disease-transmission contacts among the elements, however lack of data or delays in providing updated records may hinder its use, especially for time-varying patterns. Here we explore to what extent it is possible to use past temporal data of a system's pattern of contacts to predict the risk of infection of its elements during an emerging outbreak, in absence of updated data. We focus on two real-world temporal systems; a livestock displacements trade network among animal holdings, and a network of sexual encounters in high-end prostitution. We define the node's loyalty as a local measure of its tendency to maintain contacts with the same elements over time, and uncover important non-trivial correlations with the node's epidemic risk. We show that a risk assessment analysis incorporating this knowledge and based on past structural and temporal pattern properties provides accurate predictions for both systems. Its generalizability is tested by introducing a theoretical model for generating synthetic temporal networks. High accuracy of our predictions is recovered across different settings, while the amount of possible predictions is system-specific. The proposed method can provide crucial information for the setup of targeted intervention strategies.","tags":["Cattle","Epidemiology","Infectious disease epidemiology","Livestock","Medical risk factors","Probability distribution","Veterinary diseases","Veterinary epidemiology"],"title":"Predicting Epidemic Risk from Past Temporal Contact Data","type":"publication"}]
